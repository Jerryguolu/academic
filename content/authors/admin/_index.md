Hi! Thank you for visiting my page! I am Jerry, a graduate student majoring in Clinical Medicine at Guangzhou Medical University. I am dedicated to virology and respiratory diseases, while also maintaining a profound interest in the molecular biology of lung cancer, in hopes of discovering more effective treatments. Currently, I am a member of the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease (SKLRD), where I work with my peers in a diversified team to explore and tackle complex challenges in respiratory diseases. I firmly believe in the power of scientific research, and I look forward to collaborating with more researchers to contribute to the cause of global health.
